\chapter{Title of chapter 2}

The title of a subsequent chapter should always appear on a new page. Every paragraph containing the title of a chapter or subchapter has the following intervals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item top 12 pt., 
	\item bottom 6 pt.
\end{itemize}

\section{Subchapter title}

References in the text to literature should show in square brackets their reference number from the \textbf{Bibliography} \cite{hennessy2012computer-architecture} or the name of the author/s and year of publication [Kowalski J., 2002] and page number in the case of citations [Kowalski J., 2002, p. 3].

The \textbf{Bibliography} should be arranged alphabetically or in the order items are mentioned in the chapter. If several items of literature are referred to at one point in the text, a dash may be used in the square brackets [1-5] if they are in consecutive order in the \textbf{Bibliography}, or if their order is not consecutive, using commas, as follows: [1, 3, 5]. 

An example of bibliographic entries is shown in the Bibliography chapter.

Figures are numbered in the order in which they appear in the chapter. In the caption below a figure, the number of the figure is preceded by the abbreviation ‘Fig.’ and the appropriate chapter number, e.g. ‘Fig.~2.1.’

Figures appearing in the thesis should be centred. The spacing in a paragraph containing a figure should be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item top 12 pt,
	\item bottom 0 pt.
\end{itemize}

Every figure must be referred to in the text, for example as follows: `Fig.~\ref{fig:ETI-logo}. presents\ldots'. 

If the thesis is written in English, all the tables and figures must also be presented in the English language.

An example of a properly presented figure and caption is provided below.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{./img/LogoETI_en}
	\caption{Emblem of Gdańsk University of Technology.}
	\label{fig:ETI-logo}
\end{figure}

The caption below the figure should be centered, have a 9 pt. font size and end with a full stop. The top margin should be 6 pt., the bottom margin 12 pt. and the spacing should be single.

The first paragraph below a figure should have a top margin of 12 pt.



\subsection{Subchapter section heading}

Every paragraph containing a subchapter section heading should have the following spacing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item top 12 pt., 
	\item bottom 6 pt.
\end{itemize}



\section{Subchapter heading}

Variables should be written in italics, e.g. $x, ni, ni+1$, whereas symbols denoting vectors or matrices should be written in bold, e.g. $\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{A}$. The minus sign should directly precede the number without a space, e.g. $-20$. There must always be a space between a numerical value and unit of measurement, e.g. $1\,\mathrm{V}$ or $10\,\mathrm{km}$.

Preferably, the insertion of equations (INSERT -\textgreater{} Equation) directly into the text should be avoided. If there is a possibility of legibly inserting an equation in one line, it should be done as in the following examples: $1/2t^2$ or $e^{2x+1}$. This should be immediately followed by an explanation as to what the particular symbols denote, e.g. where: $t$ --– time [s].

Equations that might become illegible when written in a single line should be written in a separate paragraph, e.g.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:exemplary-equation}
	s = v_0 \cdot t + \frac{a \cdot t^2}{2}
\end{equation}
where: \\
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{1.25cm}p{0.5cm}X}
	$s$		& ---	& linear displacement with constant acceleration [m], \\
	$v_0$ 	& ---	& initial velocity [m/s], \\
	$t$		& ---	& time of object motion [s], \\
	$a$		& ---	& acceleration [m/s\textsuperscript{2}].
\end{tabularx}

Every equation should be centered. Its number should be preceded by the chapter number and a dot, in parentheses. Every equation has to be referred to in the text, e.g. `Equation~\eqref{eq:exemplary-equation} allows us to estimate\ldots'.

Any footnotes should appear below a line at the bottom of the page,\footnote{Footnotes should be written using Arial 9 pt.} and there numbering should be consecutive throughout the thesis. To make footnotes use NUMBERING OPTIONS -\textgreater{} add footnote.
